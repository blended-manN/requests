                We are gonna fill up this whitespace with useless text because at this point this page does not really have a right to exist.
                If you want to make chocolate brownies this is not the place because I am the worst baker imaginable, I managed to use olive
                oil instead of butter in fried rice. Fried Rice is very good. You can eat it raw, with your partner, with your pet cockroach(es)
                and while taking a dump. It is a very versatile food. Legend has it that Yoshua Yorbius was the inventor of Fried Rice
                when the Follicle came upon him and told him the ways of Chickens and Mice. He then ran out into the cherry blossom
                forest and chopped down multiple shrubs to bring to the village to make the fried rice. He wrote down the recipe in an olive
                juice (not oil) jar and stuffed it inside an active volcano never to be tasted again.
